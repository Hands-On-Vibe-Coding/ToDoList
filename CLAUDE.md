# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a ToDo application project developed using the "Vibe Coding" methodology - a natural language-based rapid development approach. The project is currently in the requirements definition phase, with comprehensive documentation in the `docs/` directory.

## Project Status

**Current Phase**: Requirements gathering and planning
**Code Status**: No implementation yet - awaiting PRD completion

## Documentation Structure

All major decisions and development progress are documented in:
- `/docs/prd.md` - Product Requirements Document with questions to be answered
- `/docs/tutorial.md` - Step-by-step documentation of the Vibe Coding process
- `/docs/chat.md` - Historical record of all conversations and decisions

## Development Approach

This project follows a documentation-first approach with these rules:
1. Record all major decisions in the appropriate documentation files
2. Update tutorial.md with each completed step
3. Maintain chat.md as a historical record
4. Answer PRD questions before starting implementation

## Next Steps

Before implementing any code:
1. Complete the PRD by answering all requirements questions
2. Choose the technology stack based on PRD decisions
3. Initialize the project with the chosen framework
4. Set up build, test, and development commands

## Important Notes

- This is a learning project for the "Vibe Coding" methodology
- Emphasis on natural language communication and rapid development
- All architectural decisions should be documented before implementation
- No code exists yet - the project is in planning phase

## Development Rules

This project follows specific rules defined in `.claude/rules.md`:
- All documentation and communication in Korean
- Core logic must be developed using TDD
- Update docs/chat.md, docs/tasks.md, and docs/tutorial.md before commits
- Document all processes for the Vibe Coding tutorial book
